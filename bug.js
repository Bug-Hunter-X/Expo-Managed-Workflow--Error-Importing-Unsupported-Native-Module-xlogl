This error typically occurs when using Expo's managed workflow and attempting to import or use a native module that isn't properly configured or supported within the Expo environment. Expo's managed workflow bundles a set of pre-defined modules.  If you try to use a module that's outside this set without proper configuration (like using an external native module without an Expo compatible wrapper or using a bare workflow), you will encounter this issue.  For instance, directly importing `react-native-camera` without its Expo-compatible counterpart will likely fail.  The error message might not be very clear, leading to confusion.
